# Sodoku Solver on MIPS
A MIPS implementation of a sudoku solver

## Description
This project is my final output for my course on machine language and assembly programming course. The tasks involve solving 4x4 sudoku boards first, then solve 9x9 sudoku board afterwards using MIPS assembly programming language. The repository contains separate solutions for 4x4 and 9x9 sudoku boards. 

## Remarks 
However, I believe that despite the seemingly separate solutions for the sudoku boards one may be able to create one program for both cases and to generalize it to nxn boards. There's a solution named Dancing Links method inspired from Donald Knuth and I highly suggest you watch his lectures on the topic.
